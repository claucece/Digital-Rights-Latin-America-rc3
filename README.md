# Welcome to the Digital Rights Latin America Panel for rC3

Find me in [github](https://github.com/claucece/Digital-Rights-Latin-America-rc3)

This is a panel in which we will discuss the state of digital rights in
Latin America. It will be held on the [Chaos Communication Congress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_Communication_Congress),
on its first online edition: [rC3](https://events.ccc.de/2020/09/04/rc3-remote-chaos-experience/).

Oftentimes, we read about the state of digital rights on the Global North and
their challenges, but we hear little from the Global South. What is, then, the
state of digital rights on the Global South and, specially, in Latin America?
Are those rights threatened in the same way that they are in the Global North?
Do those rights apply in the same way? In this panel with leading human rights
and technology experts from Latin America, we will explore these questions.
We will touch upon the history of digital censorship in Latin America, how it
has evolved and how surveillance in the region is increasing.

This form takes inspiration from the [pl-hci-school-2020](https://shriram.github.io/pl-hci-school-2020/)
organized by Sarah Chasins, Elena Glassman, Shriram Krishnamurthi and Hila Peleg,
and by the [Fourteenth Algorithmic Number Theory Symposium, ANTS-XIV](https://www.math.auckland.ac.nz/~sgal018/ANTS/index.html)
organized by Steven Galbraith.
